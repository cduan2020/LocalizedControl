# Dependency


In the power grid control problem, Matpower 6.0 (https://matpower.org/download/) is used for power flow calculation.


# Usage

`Wup = InfoDistanceUpperbdd(normA)`: Caculate the upper bound on the information distance matrix from the norm of the blocks of the system coupling matrix A, i.e., `normA(i,j) = norm(A_{ij})`.

`[nlist, dlist] = ucs_geodesic_k(Wup,i,k)`: Calculate the information neighborhood of size k centered at node i (Algorithm 1). The output nlist is the node list for the information neighborhood, and dlist is the corresponding list of information distances.

`[nlist, dlist] = ucs_geodesic_tau(Wup,i,tau)`: Calculate the information neighborhood of radius tau centered at node i (Algorithm 1). The output nlist is the node list for the information neighborhood, and dlist is the corresponding list of information distances.
